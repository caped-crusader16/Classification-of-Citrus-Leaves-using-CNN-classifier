# Classification-of-Citrus-Leaves-using-CNN-classifier
In this assignment, our objective is Classification of Citrus Leaves Data using CNN classifier. Here, we have compared classifications using 3 different optimizers such as Adam, RMSprops (Root Mean Squared Props), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) using different metrics like Accuracy, Precision and Recall. Hyperparameters for each case has been tunned to get the most optimized accuracy.
